# Welcome to the Game!

```Hello World!```
This is my first blog post. I am making this blog to keep track of my progress during a game jam. In keeping with the jam's schedule I will be updating this blog with updates on my learning progression as I tackle basic game dev concepts throughout the year.

The first few months (Jan - March 2022) should mostly be marked with recaps, thoughtful moments and (hopefully) tiny example project showcases as I traverse this new field.

I plan to post on a weekly basis, but this may change as I am also still in college and will prioritize my studies where conflicts and pinches in time happen.

Nevertheless, I am eager to get my hands dirty in all sorts of coding and gamedev work!
